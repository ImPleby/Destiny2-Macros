  ## Warlock Skate
  - First you need to download 7-Zip it's required.
	Link here: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
	
	- Then download the BiglySteam.zip from my discord server. Extract everything in BiglySteam.zip to Desktop
	
	- Type Steam into the Windows search bar right click "Steam" then click Open file location a File Explorer will open right click "Steam" again and click Properties. Look in Target and if it has ***Program Files (x86)*** in it, this is the default install path. Remember this.
  
  ## Always On Time Sparrow Flying
  - First read what version you want from here: https://pastebin.com/raw/Gmn6B0XJ
  - Open the SteamPlusX.X folder. Start Installer.bat and choose the version you want to install. Next if your "Steam" is installed in the default path choose "Default Path" and if its not then choose "Find Steam Directory". Remember what version you chose and choose it. If you chose normal mode a new cmd window will open. Press 4 then Enter and press 8 then Enter.
  - The SteamPlus folder will be moved to the Desktop unless you had the folder open then it won't, move it manually if needed.
  
  ## Exotic Sparrow Flying
  - If your using Stealth Mode skip the first the bullet
  - Go to where "Steam" is installed. Look for "DLLInjector.exe" right click it and create a shortcut. Rename the shortcut to steam **(The name MUST be steam or it will not work)**.
  - Move the SteamPlus folder wherever you like, but remember if you move it again later on it will most likely stopped working.
  - Two options you can do is have it on your Desktop or Start menu or both.
	- **Making shortcut**: Open SteamPlus folder right click SteamPlus.bat and create a shortcut, name the shortcut whatever you want then move it to your Desktop. You can also change the icon if you like, I provided one in the SteamPlus folder in the Icon folder. To change the icon right click the shortcut you made and click Properties > Change icon > Browse and Navigate to the SteamPlus folder and Icon folder and double-click black_steam.ico > OK > OK and your done. You can download your own icon if you want.
	- **Start menu method**: Copy the shortcut we just made and type Run in the Windows search bar and open it. Type shell:start menu a File Explorer will open, paste the shortcut in there. Obviously if you don't want the desktop one you can delete it.

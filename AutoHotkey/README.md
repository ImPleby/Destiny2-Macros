  Default Keybinds:<br/>
  Skate = B<br/>
  Flat Skate = N<br/>
  Toggle On/Off = =<br/>
  Exit app = F4<br/>
  
  If you want to change the binds, edit the Hunter Skate.ahk file by right clicking it and click edit.
  Only change the letters under the arrows. So if I wanted the skate bind to be K I would change the B to K. For mouse side buttons they are called XButton1 and XButton2
```
;        Skate Bind ↓↓↓ | Change it to whatever you want.
HunterSkateKeyBind = B

;            Flat Sakte ↓↓↓ | Change it to whatever you want.
HunterFlatSkateKeyBind = N

;  Shatterdive Bind ↓↓↓ | Change it to whatever you want.
ShatterdiveKeyBind = X
```

  If you want to change the binds, edit the Rocket Fly.ahk file by right clicking it and click edit.
  Only change the letters under the arrows. So if I wanted the rocket fly bind to be K I would change the B to K. For mouse side buttons they are called XButton1 and XButton2 Mouse buttons not recommended for rocket fly to minimize errors.<br/>
  You'll need to change the sensitivity value to be able to grapple onto the rocket. I'll provide some values but they might not work for your sensitivity so you're gonna have to test it on your own.<br/>
  Resolution = 1440p | DPI = 530 | In-game sensitivity = 8 | Macro Sensitivity = 27.5
```
;  Fly Bind ↓↓↓ | Change it to would whatever you want.
FlyKeyBind = B

; Sensitivity ↓↓↓↓ | Change it to what works for you.
Sensitivity = 27.5

;  Grenade Bind ↓↓↓ | Change it to would whatever you want.
GrenadeKeyBind = Q
